Amazing sound effects can be spotted, whether they stay or move. The slab does not reach the facades of the buildings which dominate it, many hoppers covered by a grid or a metallo-textile structure let pass, or even locally, the railway sounds of Montparnasse 1 (transverse wharf and platforms ) And the activity of the transverse hall of Montparnasse 2. New activities are now perceptible on the slab: tennis courts, kindergartens, waterfalls .... The sound background remains, more or less discreet according to the schedules, the activity of the station.
